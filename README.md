# flutter_notification_listener (forked)

> [!IMPORTANT]\
> This is the fork of [jiusanzhou/flutter_notification_listener] which uses the ForegroundService to listen notifications on background. This version removes the implementation of ForegroundService and prevents the package from creating new FlutterEngine to run the service. So it can be handled by your own ForegroundService implementation.
> <br>\
> If you don't want to create your own ForegroundService, you need to use the original version of [flutter_notification_listener](https://github.com/jiusanzhou/flutter_notification_listener).
